# COVID-19' impact on fashion retailing consumer behaviour

<!-- badges: start -->

### Objective:

The goal of this repository is to document through open-source data the impact of COVID-19 on customer' behaviour in the fashion retailing sector.

### Methodology:

The methodology is simple, in summarized fashion the most important steps:

1. Google Trends search data is extracted for the main fashion categories for all the countries that have suffered since more than two weeks ago from 100 deaths due to COVID-19.
2. Define the date as event 0, where a country reached 100 cummulative deaths due to COVID-19. Countries, which have not reached this point for longer than two weeks, have been removed.
3. Based on the data before event 0, an estimation based on historical data is made of how customer behaviour should have been if COVID-19 would not have happened. For this step, the [prophet forecasting method](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is chosen to predict Google searches.
4. Last but not least, expected predicted results are compared with real search values for each category at each country. Results can be found [here as plot images](https://github.com/matbmeijer/covid19_fashion_trends/tree/master/output/plots).


Here is am xemple for Spain:
