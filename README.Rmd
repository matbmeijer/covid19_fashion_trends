# COVID-19' impact on fashion retailing consumer behaviour

<!-- badges: start -->

### Objective:

The goal of this repository is to document through open-source data the impact of COVID-19 on customer' behaviour in the fashion retailing sector.

### Methodology:

The methodology is simple - the following main steps are followed:

1. Google search data of general fashion categories is extracted for all the countries that have suffered since more than two weeks ago from 75 deaths caused by COVID-19.
2. Similar as in an event study, the event 0 date is selected for each country based on when the country reached 75 cummulative deaths caused by COVID-19. Countries, which have not reached this point for longer than two weeks, have been removed.
3. Based on the search data before event 0, a search estimation is made if COVID-19 would not have happened. For this step, the [prophet forecasting method](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is chosen to predict Google searches for each fashion category for each country.
4. Last but not least, expected predicted results are compared with real search values for each category at each country. Results can be found [here as plot images](https://github.com/matbmeijer/covid19_fashion_trends/tree/master/output/plots).

### Results:
